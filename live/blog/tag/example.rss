                <p>Everyone has written those one-off administration or check scripts.
There are probably a few cluttering your project root or bin directory right now.
Those have a problem beyond just the clutter: duplication.</p>

<p>Programmers hate duplication because of skew.
If code gets improved in one place, it is unlikely to be improved in all places, unless there is only the one.
So that script you wrote a while back, the one with the database connection you hand-rolled, is that still correct?</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://mojolicious.io/blog/2017/12/05/day-5-your-apps-built-in-commands">previous article in this series</a> I talked about the built-in commands available to your application.
The final command was <a href="http://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Command/eval"><code>eval</code></a>.
I mentioned that when combined with predefined behaviors, the command could be great for administrative tasks.
That&#39;s true, but you need to know what to eval in order to do so.</p>

<p>To formalize that process, we can go one step further: defining our own commands.
By doing this your application&#39;s administative behaviors can take arguemnts and provide optional switches as well as give usage messages.
In this way these administative commands decouple themselves from knowledge of the application&#39;s internals and become useful to a broader set of users.</p>
