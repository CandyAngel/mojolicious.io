                <p>In Mojolicious, when processing a request and preparing a response one of the most important concepts is &quot;the stash&quot;.
Since it is a non-blocking framework, your code can&#39;t use global variables to store any state during processing.
If you did and some other code were to run, it could very easily get cross-talk between requests.</p>

<p>The stash is the place you can store information while you process it.
It is just a simple hash reference that is attached to the controller object that is processing the request.
It lives and dies with that one transaction.</p>
